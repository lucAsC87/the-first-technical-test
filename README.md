# the-first-technical-test
Back in June 2022, I tried my hand at my first test with an Italian software company, after a little over a year and a half of experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The test consisted of:
- build a database in SQL for a library lending system.
- create a document explaining the configuration of the database
- develop an API in Laravel to access the database
- create an interface to interact with the database.

Although the test didn't (obviously) go well and I only accomplished (poorly) three of the four planned parts, this repository is meant to be a record of what I did with my then very limited skills, also useful as a reminder of the strides I've made since then and the importance in giving things the right amount of time.
Excelsior!
